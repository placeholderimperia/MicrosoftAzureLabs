                                  Lab 01 - Manage Microsoft Entra ID Identities

                                               Lab introduction

This is the first in a series of labs for Azure Administrators.
In this lab, I learn about users and groups.
Users and groups are the basic building blocks for an identity solution.

This lab requires an Azure subscription. Your subscription type may affect the availability of features in this lab.
You may change the region, but the steps are written using North EU.

Estimated timing: 30 minutes
                                             Lab scenario
Your organization is building a new lab environment for pre-production testing of apps and services.
A few engineers are being hired to manage the lab environment, including the virtual machines.
To allow the engineers to authenticate by using Microsoft Entra ID, you have been tasked with provisioning users and groups.
To minimize administrative overhead, membership of the groups should be updated automatically based on job titles.

Job skills
Task 1: Create and configure user accounts.
Task 2: Create groups and add members.

       Task 1: Create and configure user accounts
In this task, you will create and configure user accounts. User accounts will store user data such as name, department, location, and contact information.

Sign in to the Azure portal - https://portal.azure.com.
Search for and select Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID is Azure's cloud-based identity and access management solution.

   - Create a new user
1. Select Users, then in the New user drop-down select Create new user.
2. Create a new user with the following settings (leave others with their defaults). On the Properties tab notice all the different types of information that can be included in the user account.

Setting	                    Value
User principal name	        az104-user1
Display name	              az104-user1
Auto-generate password	    checked
Account enabled	            checked
Job title (Properties tab)	IT Lab Administrator
Department (Properties tab)	IT
Usage location (Properties tab)	United States

Once you have finished reviewing, select Review + create and then Create.
Refresh the page and confirm your new user was created.

  - Invite an external user
In the New user drop-down select Invite an external user.

Setting	                  Value
Email	                    your email address
Display name	            your name
Send invite message	      check the box
Message	                  Welcome to Azure and our group project

Move to the Properties tab. Complete the basic information, including these fields.

Setting	            Value
Job title	          IT Lab Administrator
Department	        IT
Usage location (Properties tab)	EU

Select Review + invite, and then Invite.
Refresh the page and confirm the invited user was created. You should receive the invitation email shortly.


          Task 2: Create groups and add members
In this task, I create a group account. Group accounts can include user accounts or devices.
These are two basic ways members are assigned to groups: Statically and Dynamically.
Static groups require administrators to add and remove members manually. 
Dynamic groups update automatically based on the properties of a user account or device. For example, job title.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select Microsoft Entra ID. In the Manage blade, select Groups.
 - Expiration - lets you configure a group lifetime in days. After that time the group must be renewed by the owner.
 - Naming policy - lets you configure blocked words and add a prefix or suffix to group names.

2.In the All groups blade, select + New group and create a new group.

Setting	                  Value
Group type	              Security
Group name	              IT Lab Administrators
Group description	        Administrators that manage the IT lab
Membership type	          Assigned

Note: An Entra ID Premium P1 or P2 license is required for dynamic membership. If other Membership types are available, the options will show up in the drop-down.

3.Select No owners selected.
4.In the Add owners page, search for and select yourself (shown in the top right corner) as the owner. Notice you can have more than one owner.
5.Select No members selected.
6.In the Add members pane, search for and select the az104-user1 and the guest user you invited. Add both of the users to the group.
7.Select Create to deploy the group.
8.Refresh the page and ensure your group was created.
9.Select the new group and review the Members and Owners information.

Note: You may be managing a large number of groups. Does your organization have a plan for creating groups and adding members?

Understand Microsoft Entra ID. Compare Microsoft Entra ID to Active Directory DS, learn about Microsoft Entra ID P1 and P2, and explore Microsoft Entra Domain Services for managing domain-joined devices and apps in the cloud.
Create Azure users and groups in Microsoft Entra ID. Create users in Microsoft Entra ID. Understand different types of groups. Create a group and add members. Manage business-to-business guest accounts.
Allow users to reset their password with Microsoft Entra self-service password reset. Evaluate self-service password reset to allow users in your organization to reset their passwords or unlock their accounts. Set up, configure, and test self-service password reset.

Key takeaways
Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are some main takeways for this lab:

A tenant represents your organization and helps you to manage a specific instance of Microsoft cloud services for your internal and external users.
Microsoft Entra ID has user and guest accounts. Each account has a level of access specific to the scope of work expected to be done.
Groups combine together related users or devices. There are two types of groups including Security and Microsoft 365.
Group membership can be statically or dynamically assigned.
